<p>Got a full day of proposed Natural Resource Road Act (NRRA) legislation meetings. The Government ORV stakeholder consultations are now coming back on line after a hiatus.</p>

<p>Go to http://bcpsc.ca to link to Government NRRA information pages. This proposed legislation could have large changes on our sport, both increased access but with more requirements.</p>

<p>We have been involved with this proposed legislation for over 5 years, and expect it to take some time before it is finalized. Part of that process is ORV stakeholder consultations. Who in the dirt bike community is interested in working with BCORMA to provide expertise and solutions to Government on this major legislation that could effect our sport for decades to come?</p>
