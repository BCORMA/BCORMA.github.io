Currently, we are developing a riding area west of Jordan River on public land for XC. Tansky Riding Area covers an area of 5000 acres, following old skid roads, with inter-connecting single track. There is presently over 30km of track to ride on, with more installed every week. 

Tansky Main riding area
Currently, Juan de Fuca Enduro Riders and the Victoria Motorcycle Club is developing this riding area west of Jordan River on public land for XC motorcycling. TanskyMain covers an area of 20 square Kms, following old skid roads, with inter-connecting single track. This area is developing into great technical XC off-road motorcycle area. Expect 8 -18km/hr avg if you are good. Don't expect speed and big sweeping corners. This is VI at its best. Expect a great time, where your time is measured in smiles "I did that", not racking up mileage.

All around there are major logging road arteries that lead for 20 - 100 km, giving the area a nice blend of cruise and technical. If you are interested in linking together a route for your outing, call Ken at KenCo Motorcycles, Sooke (250-642-3924). He can provide you with Dual-sport, enduro, XC trials loops to enjoy the area. She is a beauty.

The main trails are dual-sport friendly. Watch for the rocky creek crossings and entrances, some can bite if you are asleep. Above all, enjoy this fine old planet, and don't forget to smile. And buy the trail-builders a beer next time. They put their heart into this for you to enjoy.

Notice to Non-Offroad Motorcycle Users

This area is managed by the Victoria Motorcycle Club with permission from the BC Provincial government for off-road motorcycle use. The trails are primarily single-track, with very few of the main skid roads usable by quads. If you can't negotiate the trails because of your vehicle width, do not open the single track into a double track, or double track into a freeway. This ruins the trails for their intended use. We have intentionally kept the wider skid roads narrow and flowing side to side to keep the speeds down and interest up. Don't remake them into freeways.

4WDs: This area really has no good 4Wheeling. The terrain is mostly rolling, with very little rock. Please do not trash the trails trying to make it into what it isn't. If you have any questions about where else to explore with your 4 wheel drive, please email Andy James (VMC member and 4WD enthusiast). He has many areas to suggest for great 4Wheeling.

Notice to Trail Builders

If you would like to build off-road motorcycle trails here, please consult with the VMC XC Committee or discuss it with Ken at KenCo Motorcycles, Sooke (250-642-3924). We have the responsibility to be good land stewards of the area.
Access
The Jordan Main access road is controlled by Western Forest Products, and is closed during the week for log hauls. There is active logging north of Tansky off the N500. So limit your use of the area to the weekends, or be very careful for log haul trucks.

To get to Tansky Main riding area, head west from Jordan River about 3 km, take the major logging road to the north right across from China Beach entrance. Head uphill until you reach the clear-cut and views of the Juan de Fuca Strait. Look for a road to your right and pull in here. Park along the edge or in the pull through near the fire ring. Off-load. Enjoy the views across the Strait to the Olympics.

To access the main infeed trail to the riding area, head uphill to the gate. Pass the gate on the right. Head up Jordan River Road for maybe 2 km to just past the 65 tonne bridge. Look for a trail on your left into the bush. This is the start of Tansky Main.

If you insist on accessing this area during during WPF active haul hours (M thru F 6:30am to 5:00 pm): Stop by the WPF office in Jordan River first. Arrange to follow an unloaded truck in to the first gate. Do not go up the hill beyond where it is narrow and steep. Off-load here, or use the VMC gate key and drive up to the Tansky on JR Main to off-load. Don't go higher up the Jordan North Main than the Jordan Main gate. It is narrow, twisty and steep, leaving little room for safety. Watch for loaded trucks coming out at speed. Be ready to go into the ditch and get out of their way. Be safe and don't get us kicked out of the area. Enough said.

Trail Building
We usually meet at 9am Sundays at the Castle Inn/Restaurant (just over the bridge going into Sooke) for breakfast, then we head out around 10:15 to the off-load area. All are welcome. If you have any questions, call Ken at KenCo Motorcycles, Sooke (250-642-3924)

Come on out, flag out a new single track trail, brush it, and name it. Better than some cornerstone on a building. We'll remember you. Promise.
