excerpt: "From RSTBC Recreation Officer Noelle Kekula:\r\n\r\nWith the recent rain/snow
  melt issues there are concerns of additional damage to the trail system and a chance
  of more wash outs, therefore, I am recommending that all ORV trails not be ridden
  on until soils begin to dry out.\r\n\r\nI’m unsure of what the soil conditions are
  in the Greenstone/Duffy/Inks area, but if riding continues this will create additional
  rutting and accelerate erosion, which will cause unnecessary damage to the trial
  network.  This will require much restoration (money) when the soils have dried out.\r\n\r\nThanks\r\n\r\nNoelle

From RSTBC Recreation Officer Noelle Kekula:

With the recent rain/snow melt issues there are concerns of additional damage to the trail system and a chance of more wash outs, therefore, I am recommending that all ORV trails not be ridden on until soils begin to dry out.

I’m unsure of what the soil conditions are in the Greenstone/Duffy/Inks area, but if riding continues this will create additional rutting and accelerate erosion, which will cause unnecessary damage to the trial network.  This will require much restoration (money) when the soils have dried out.

Thanks
