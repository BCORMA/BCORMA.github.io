	<strong>Squamish - Insurance compliance update: Sat May 27 &amp; Sun May 28th at the Forest Service Road ( FSR) known as the Mamquam. </strong></p>
<p>
	On both days Provincial Conservation Officers (CO) asked for proof of insurance. The officers were peaceful, and friendly. Both times I was asked, my motorcycle was still in my truck, and hadn&#39;t been ridin yet. , I guess there is a presumption that you are going to ride on the FSR, although you can acess the trail head without being on the FSR if you know the area, i dont think the trails require insurance.</p>
<p>
	The CO&#39;s had no shortage of people to check and it looked like a few riders ended up with tickets.&nbsp; According to the CO I talked to, spark arresters will be checked also as we move into forest fire high alert weather.</p>
<p>
	Buy some insurance from BCORMA-the platinum pass and be certain of your coverage, or at least be up to date with exactly where you are able to ride without the insurance. ,( print off the trail map and bring it with you, to show you are in the know.) You also need to carry ID.</p>

	Have fun.<br />
