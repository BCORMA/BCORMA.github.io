<p>To BCORMA,<br />
<br />
The Blue Mountain Motor Cycle Club would like to express its sincere appreciation and gratitude to BCORMA for its support since 2009.</p>

<p>Blue Mountain holds a network of trails which will challenge the intermediate rider right up to the most extreme riders.&nbsp; These trails can help to hone skills for off road riding while bringing together riders through trail days as well as the annual fun ride. Blue Mountain features roots, rocks, mud and other obstacles for the riders pain and pleasure.&nbsp; There are several lookouts on the mountain ranging from the power lines which gives amazing views of the Fraser Valley up to a lookout on top of the mountain which is at 1000 feet.<br />
<br />
The Blue Mountain Motorcycle Club is also supported by local motorcycle shops as well as non-motorcycle related businesses. We promote proper trail etiquette as well as respect for the environment and local homeowners and businesses in the area.<br />
<br />
For the 2009 and 2010 BCORMA was able to secure a large amount of funding from the National Trails Coalition. With this funding the BMMC was able to hire contractors to remediate trails. The BMMC also hired a Registered Forester, Ron Manke, who GPSd all of the trails and came up with a Hydrology Report pin pointing areas which needed bridging or other remediation. This report was huge in helping with the standard of which the trails are maintained today.<br />
With this funding the BMMC was able to employ up to 10 fulltime workers for 10 months. Most of these were displaced forestry workers recently laid off due the economic downturn.<br />
<br />
In 2009 - 2010 with NTC trail funding BMMC Contractors were able to build 66 bridges for a total lineal span of 666.2 meters. A total of 46 km of trails were remediated in 2009 and 2010.<br />
<br />
Again in 2014 - 2015 BCORMA was instrumental in putting funds in line from the NTC as well as from the Province through the Ministry of Forests, Lands and Natural Resources. With these funds the BMMC contractors as well as volunteers were able to build 7 new bridges for a total of 107 meters of new bridging. There were 2.3 km of trail remediated with the funds.<br />
<br />
So again, big thanks to BCORMA for all of their help over the past 7 years!<br />
<br />
Sincerely,<br />
Clay Walker<br />
Past President<br />
