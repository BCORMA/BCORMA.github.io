	The weekend of April/16th is BCORMA&#39;s inaugural Rider School and Recreational Trail Ride weekend at Ok Falls, north of Osoyoos, BC.</p>
<p>
	For 2011, BCORMA is providing Provincial Rider Schools to provide riders with more skills and enjoyment for off-road motorcycling. Mike Fetter and Crew will be giving years of hard learned skills to Novice and up riders in these clinics. Past clinics include kids, so please feel welcome if you are younger, or struggling novice. These classes are just what you need to become a more capable rider.</p>
<p>
	First clinic is scheduled for April/16th at OK Falls, with SODBC Creaky Bones Fun Ride to follow on Sunday. Mike Fetterer, Jaime Skinner, and Mark Cahill will be training kids and novice riders in the morning, and Intermediates and up riders in the afternoon, amping up your skills and preparing riders for the A &amp; B loops of the SODBC&#39;s Creeky Bones Fun Ride on Sunday.</p>
<p>
	Pre-registration will be through the BCORMA Store, with a discount for BCORMA Trail Pass holders. I&#39;ll have a rider pre-registration up in the BCORMA Store shortly. There is a limit of ~20 students per morning and afternoon class to make sure everyone gets enough personal training attention. Everyone is invited to the Creaky Bones Fun Ride.</p>
<p>
	Any questions, post in the forum under Rider Schools: http://bcorma.geovisionenvironmental.com/forum/86 (Register on the site to access the forums, no trail pass required). For further information, check out the poster and Mike&#39;s BCORMA Rider&#39;s School PowerPoint introduction to see what will be taught at: http://bcorma.geovisionenvironmental.com/node/198</p>
<p>
	See you there! Peter</p>
