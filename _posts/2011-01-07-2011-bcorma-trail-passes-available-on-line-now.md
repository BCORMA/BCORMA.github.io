	If you are riding on Forest Service Roads, particularly around the Lower Mainland, you need insurance. Expect increased RCMP stop checks and patrols for 2011 is the word on the street. Your PI Trail Pass covers you with $1 million 3rd party liability insurance, plus contributes to giving you maps, better parking, trail signage, and buys the trail volunteers chains and fuel to run their saws.</p>
<p>
	The pricing on the Platinum-Insured pass has stayed the same as 2010 at $165 for the full year. We have tuned up the insurance form so you can just fill it in and email it back to us. No print &amp; scan -&gt; email needed.</p>
