<p><strong>Vedder Mountain Closure - Important Notice</strong></p>

<p>The Ministry of Natural Resources and Forests has closed access to Vedder Mtn. to all users ( motorized, non-motorized, and pedestrian) from July 20-Aug.20 to repair and upgrade Parmenter Rd. The conditions of this closure are as follows:</p>

<p>Parmenter Road and all trails are closed from July 20th to Aug 20th but will be open on weekends from 6 pm Friday eve to 6 am Monday morning.</p>

<p>The road will be gated to deter people from using the area. This is a legal closure so if people are going to be choosing to ignore the signage, they will be risking getting charged. NOTE: There will be active clearing/falling and chipping of trees along both sides ( possibly falling over high use trails) of the road involving heavy equipment.</p>

<p>For your own safest and to not interfere with this road improvement project, please respect this closure.</p>
