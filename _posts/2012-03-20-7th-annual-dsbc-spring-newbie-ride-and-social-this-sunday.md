When: Sunday March 25th, 2012

Where: Chilliwack, British Columbia (only one hour East of Vancouver): Tamihi Staging Area just off Chilliwack Lake Road. (Corner of Chilliwack Lake Road and Tamihi Liumchen FSR)

Cost: FREE (but we ask riders to have a 2012 BCORMA TrailPass)

Time: 8:30am meet for breakfast at Tamihi Staging Area
10 am 'Last Rider Out'

This popular ‘first organized dual-sport event of the season in Canada’ should host more than 100 riders. We hope you've kept your calendar clear.

Skill Level: There is something for everyone. The main (EZ) route is on jeep and ATV roads + asphalt. There will be puddles, wet leaves & rocks and likely some mud. With experienced riders lending a hand it will be easy enough for any rider on any bike. Advanced riders will have the opportunity to take guided 'hard' routes into single tracks and up to (through?) the snow line that will challenge them.

RAIN or SHINE !

This event is popular and has been a huge success each of the past six years. More than an event for 'new' riders, this has proven to be a great start-of-season for many of us. Don't be shy...

•Coffee & hot breakfast will again be prepared by our good friends at the CHRISTIAN MOTORCYCLISTS ASSOCIATION. These are the nicest people you’ll meet at the crack of dawn; busy working so that we get our caffeine, protein & carbs; a great spread for a nominal charge.

•After the ride, enjoy a BBQ lunch, provided by our other great friends at the GREATER VANCOUVER MOTORCYCLE CLUB, and talk with them about their club & the rides they have planned this year.

•2012 BCORMA TrailPasses will be available for sale on-site. Have a voice in this province while supporting DSBC & local trails. www.bcorma.ca

This event comes together as a result of the financial support of many lower mainland businesses. Many will be on site & riding the event – please take every opportunity to meet them & check out their offerings. Their may even be demo equipment on-site...
