Thanks to everyone, BCORMA and our clubs spent over $2.4 million on trails stewardship in 2009 to give you better parking, new bridges, fixed up or new trails, new maps, signs to help you find your way around, and generally a great time riding.

The latest Federal budget was devoid of any funding for trails.  The National Trails Coalition requested another $25 million from the $1 billion Infrastructure Funds that were not spent in 2009.  Their request was flatly turned down, even though we did great work in 2009, performing to much higher levels than the Government departments.

We need riders and industry to continue to provide BCORMA the funds so we can continue our work making sure you have a place to ride all across the Province.  In the past we could just rough build trail anywhere, who cares.  Times have changed with new regulations, increased enforcement, need for insurance on Forest Service Roads, etc.  We need all your help by purchasing a BCORMA Trail Pass and/or making direct donations.

Use our PayPal link to donate to the trail stewardship fund or donate directly through a local club towards the BCORMA Trail Stewardship Fund!  To buy a BCORMA Platinum - Insured or Standard Trail Pass, go to our BCORMA Store.

We will be working on trails used by everyone. With 140,000 quad and off-road motorcycle riders in the Province, if everyone gave $10 - $50, we would have over $1 million to give you great riding on trails for summer motorized trail users in BC.  Think how great our riding would be with improved staging areas, camping, more trails, signed trails, and maps.

For larger donations, we can offer tax deductible receipts.  Please call us to discuss.

Please get the word out to all riders and any other trail users you know!  This is very important!
