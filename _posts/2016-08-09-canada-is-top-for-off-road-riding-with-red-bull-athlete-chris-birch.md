<p>Thanks to Kitt Stringer for helping get Chris Birch here to ride many of our great trails and experience British Columbia.<br />
<br />
According to Chris:</p>

<blockquote>
<h3>How does the terrain compare to other places you&rsquo;ve ridden?</h3>

<p>We were talking about that last night over a few beers and Canada is definitely in the top three places in the world I&rsquo;ve ridden. There is quite a lot of riding. It seems like a pretty good culture for trail building, as well. There are a lot of guys out there building and maintaining trails, which is quite unique in a first-world country. Normally, you sort of find that the poorer, more developing countries have a lot of trails because you&rsquo;re basically just riding walking trails&mdash;trails that people are using to access the mountain for food or whatever reason. A lot of the first-world countries you go, people don&rsquo;t do that.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Without all our dedicated volunteer trail stewards and clubs, we wouldn&#39;t have some of the best riding in the world.</p>
