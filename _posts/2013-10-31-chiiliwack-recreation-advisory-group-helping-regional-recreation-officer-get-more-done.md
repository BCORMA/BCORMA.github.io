<p>Getting great things done in BC&#39;s trail community requires collaboration, and in Chilliwack Valley they are getting it done!</p>

<p>Three main riding areas, fisher trails, dual sport trails, hard-core mountain bike trails, horse trails, Trans-Canada Trails, campsites, staging areas.&nbsp; Its all managed by the Regional Recreation Officer Mike Peters with help from all the trail groups.</p>

<p>Wally Klammer, BCORMA Director &amp; Chipmunk Creek Trail Riders &amp; Greater Vancouver Motorcycle Club , sits on the Chilliwack Recreational Advisory Group.&nbsp; Here is his report:</p>

<p>The Chilliwack Recreation Advisory Group is unique in British Columbia, as the Recreation Officer meets regularly with representatives of hiking, equestrian, mountain bike, ATV, snowmobile, kyack &amp; canoe, naturalist, dirt bike and 4x4 clubs, to discuss ways to better the sport for all user groups. Everyone learns more about the needs of other groups, and how a little give and take and mutual respect can go a long way. The Recreation Officer saves a lot of time by getting a clear picture, directly from the people most involved, of how best to allocate limited resources. The Recreation Officer also gets a&nbsp; lot of volunteer labor from club members, and even cash donations. (Motorcycle and ATV clubs donated $16,000 towards the staging areas at the Rapids and Tamahi.)</p>

<p>Could other Forest Districts in B.C. benefit from setting up similar advisory groups? Something for Clubs and other Associations to consider.</p>

<p>Cheers<br />
