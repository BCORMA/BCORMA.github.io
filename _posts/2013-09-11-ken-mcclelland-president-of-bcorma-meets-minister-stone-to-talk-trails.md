<p><strong>August 29, 2013, for immediate release</strong></p>

<p>It was my pleasure today to meet with <strong>Hon. Todd Stone, Minister of Transportation and Infrastructure</strong> (MLA Kamloops-South Thompson). During our brief but productive meeting, I was able to discuss the following with Minister Stone:</p>

<ul>
	<li>The <strong>Trans-Provincial Touring Trails Network (TPTTN</strong>):&nbsp; This was new information for the Minister, and he was very positive and enthused about the concept, particularly with regard to Kamloops&rsquo; strategic location in the network, and the fact that it would <strong>link many small and medium-sized communities</strong> in the Interior. I emphasized that this is not an exclusively motorized network but a compliment to the present BC Rail Trails network, and that <strong>all trail user-groups</strong> would be welcome to use the network.</li>
	<li>Expressed <strong>thanks to the Minister</strong> for his and the previous Administration&rsquo;s <strong>financial assistance</strong> over the past few years. The success stories of the <strong>Revy Riders</strong> and <strong>GVMC</strong> are the most recent example of trail stewards leveraging grant dollars for maximum bang for the buck with their new trail network and staging areas. Other trail stewards such as <strong>Greater Kamloops Motorcycle Association, Okanagan Trail Riders</strong>, <strong>Southern Okanagan Dirt Riders, Vancouver Island Dirt Riders Association</strong> (Friends of Tansky) and others have also received varying degrees of financial assistance from the Province, all of which has been put to maximum use.</li>
	<li>The issue of <strong>taxation on current value of used equipment</strong> that the owners cannot prove taxes paid on at time of registration (when it comes). This issue continues to be <strong>extremely problematic</strong>, the <strong>Minister acknowledged his understanding</strong> of why this is a problem, and will discuss (again) with cabinet colleagues. It is probably safe to say that the Finance Dept.&rsquo;s intransigence on this issue is policy rather than politically driven, and it has proven a very tough nut to crack.</li>
	<li>Emphasized that <strong>all</strong> motorized recreation, both summer and winter, two-wheeled and four, are on the same page in terms of supporting legislation and safety regulations, and that we would prefer to see an annual vs. one time registration/licensing program <strong>provided</strong> a significant portion of annual fees goes back into the area from which it was generated, similar to HCTF vis a vis Angling and Hunting licences.</li>
	<li>I emphasized with Minister Stone that <strong>off-road motorized recreation contributes</strong> something like <strong>1 billion dollars annually</strong> to the provincial economy, and that it is a <strong>growth sector</strong> in the tourism industry.</li>
</ul>

<p>I plan to schedule a meeting with Lee Morris, ED of Tourism Kamloops in the near future with regard to attempting to have <strong>summer motorized off-road recreation</strong> recognized as a <strong>legitimate tourism industry sector</strong>. She carries a fair amount of influence with her provincial counterparts and in Victoria, and I anticipate a good result from this meeting. &nbsp;</p>
