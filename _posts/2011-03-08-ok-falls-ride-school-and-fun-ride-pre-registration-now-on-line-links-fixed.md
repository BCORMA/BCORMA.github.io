	The weekend of April 16th is BCORMA&#39;s inaugural Rider School and Recreational Trail Ride weekend at Okanagan Falls, north of Osoyoos, BC.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The southern Okanagan has a great climate, so expect warm Spring temeratures.&nbsp; Get that bike out.&nbsp; Less than 4 hrs drive from the Lower Mainland.</p>
<p>
	Families are encouraged to come and participate in the weekend.&nbsp; For the non-rider, the Okanagan offers winery tours, hiking, great food, and general relaxing away from the urban grind.&nbsp; Camping and lodging is available only 15 minutes away at <a href="http://www.vancouverisland.com/regions/towns/?townID=3439">Okanagan Falls</a>:</p>

	First clinic is scheduled for April 16th at OK Falls, with Southern Okanagan Dirt Bike Club Creaky Bones Fun Ride to follow on Sunday. Mike Fetterer, Jaime Skinner, and Mark Cahill will be training kids, beginners, and novice riders in the morning, and novice/intermediate and up riders in the afternoon, amping up your skills and preparing riders for the A &amp; B loops of the SODBC&#39;s Creeky Bones Fun Ride on Sunday.</p>
<p>
	Pre-registration is up on the BCORMA Store, with a discount for BCORMA Trail Pass holders. Go to the BCORMA Store to buy your spot in the Rider Clinic and fun ride.&nbsp; There is a limit of ~20 students per each class to make sure everyone gets enough personal training attention. Everyone is invited to the Creaky Bones Fun Ride.&nbsp; For more details, go to the BCORMA Store product pages (http://bcorma.geovisionenvironmental.com/catalog).</p>
<p>
	We are asking everyone to support the Southern Okanagan Dirt Bike Club by buying a membership with their Fun Ride registration.&nbsp; They do a ton of work to support dirt biking in BC and the Okanagan.&nbsp; The extra $5.00 is well worth it, and shows our support for their efforts.</p>
