	Hi Everyone,</p>
<p>
	I&#39;ve revised the Vedder mapbook and posted it up on the Vedder maps page.&nbsp; It now includes Section 3 that was missing from the original.</p>
<p>
	I&#39;ll work with the Vedder Mountain Trails Association to get the Vedder maps updated to include parking location, and other infromation that has been requested.</p>
<p>
	With the rains coming soon, watch for drilling the trails if they are wet, and please don&#39;t attempt trails above your skill level.&nbsp; It leads to a huge amount of trail repairs after the water energy combines with that hole you left from spinning.&nbsp; Ride smooth and preserve the trails.</p>
