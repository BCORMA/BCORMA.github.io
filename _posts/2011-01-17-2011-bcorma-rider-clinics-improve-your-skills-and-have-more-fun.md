<p>
	For 2011, BCORMA is providing Provincial Rider Schools to provide riders with more skills and enjoyment for off-road motorcycling. Mike Fetter and Crew will be giving years of hard learned skills to Novice and up riders in these clinics.&nbsp; Past clinics include kids, so please feel welcome if you are younger, or struggling novice.&nbsp; These classes are just what you need to become a more capable rider.</p>
<p>
	Take a clinic near you. It is the best and cheapest way to become a better rider. Way better than a new pipe or other bling. Check website for dates.</p>
<p>
	First clinic is scheduled for April/16th at OK Falls, with SODBC Creaky Bones Fun Ride to follow on Sunday.&nbsp; I&#39;ll have a rider pre-registration up in the BCORMA Store shortly.&nbsp; There is a limit of ~20 students per morning and afternoon classes to make sure everyone gets enough personal training attention.</p>
<p>
	Any questions, post in the forum under Rider Schools: http://bcorma.geovisionenvironmental.com/forum/86 (Register on the site to access the forums, no trail pass required)&nbsp; Check out <a href="http://bcorma.geovisionenvironmental.com/sites/default/files/bcorma-1.ppt">Mike&#39;s BCORMA Rider&#39;s School PowerPoint introduction</a> to see what will be taught.</p>
