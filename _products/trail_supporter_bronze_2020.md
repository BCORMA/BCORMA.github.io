Continued trail stewardship of our off-road motorcycle trails in BC is vital for our and our children's future recreation. The funds from the Trail Supporter Program go directly into trail stewardship projects at the riding area you specify. That includes: staging area developments, trail maintenance and rehabilitation to keep the trails sustainable & fun to ride, development of kids riding loops, signs & mapping so you know where you are, and camping area developments so your family can enjoy their stay.

BCORMA leveraged your BCORMA Trail Supporter purchases to almost $500,000 of National Trails Coalition & Recreation Sites and Trails funding.  Check out Bear Creek, Blue Mountain, Kamloops, OK Falls, Revelstoke, Smethurst, Tansky, Vedder Mountain, Whiskey Creek, Williams Lake for all the increased riding.
