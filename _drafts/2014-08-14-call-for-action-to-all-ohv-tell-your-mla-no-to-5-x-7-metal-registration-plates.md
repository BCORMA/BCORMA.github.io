ORV registration plate size feedback to MLA template

Hello [your MLA - use MLA finder below],

Are you aware of the new Bill 13, the Off Road Vehicle Act? It reached royal assent on March 24 this year. The Government and the OHV users (BCORMA) are now working out final details on how to implement this bill.

One issue is how to identify OHV vehicles. I understand the government is favouring metal license plates. However we, the OHV users (represented by BCORMA and ) are strongly urging permit stickers. Why do we not want metal license plates? Because metal license plates on off-road vehicles will invariably be bent, broken, dented, torn off while off-road riding. The metal license plates do not last and often have to be replaced. We know this from experience, as many BC OHV users have "dual sport" dirt bikes which are street legal, but can be used off road. We are constantly repairing or replacing lost license plates. Many states and provinces have also experienced this issue and favour the off road sticker.

Also, these license plates do not fit well on smaller OHVs for kids. The metal edges of the license plates are a safety hazard and could cause injury.

Can you please express my views to the Ministry responsible?

Thank you
(make sure to put down your name and address to make it legitimate)
