Reporting from over the Rockies, (you know the place with the best riding in the world ;-)

BCORMA's mandate is: The British Columbia Off-Road Motorcycle Association protects and advances the off-road motorcyclist's interests and rights to enjoy world-class trail networks in BC.

Our focus has been and continues to be on multi-use single-track trails to provide the unique experience and lifestyle dirt bikers crave.  Key items we are tackling in 2015 under our mandate are:

NTC program
$450,000 Provincial, Steward and NTC funded trail works all across BC.
See map at: http://bcorma.ca/BC_NTC_trail_works
By now, most of our funded trail works are starting to have activity on the ground.
To date:

    Bear Creek - continued development of single-track riding and supporting infrastructure improvements at this designation 36,000 Ha Recreation Site.
    Blue Mountain - trail hardening to provide increased family and youth riding opportunities at Blue Mountain.  This includes many bridges and decking to protect trail tread in this mountainous coastal rain forest environment.
    IOCO (Port Moody) - new staging area and access road to create a more visibly attractive and usable access to the trail systems.  This enhances our image with local urban governments and green space initiatives.
    OK Falls - improved facilities including 2nd outhouse, staging, camping, plus trail hardening to increase sustainability.
    Revelstoke - bridging and linkage trail to create improve access between the two trail networks.
    Smethurst - a large multi-use staging area to service the Naramata bench and higher elevation trails that are used in summer time to escape the lower Okanagan Valley heat.  It also provides for infrastructure connectivity between OK Falls and trails to the NE for more advanced riders.
    Squamish - This is a large capital trail works sub-project performed by one of the best MTB trail designer and builder in the world.  Trail hardening and sustainability are the prime focus, with some new trail sections to increase variety to be offered to increasing ridership from North Vancouver.
    Tansky - focused on redesigning trail network to increase its appeal/role as technical dirt-bike and downhill MTB single-track trail Provincial Recreation Site.  This is the only legal OHV recreation site on the south Vancouver Island. Trail hardening for sustainability, new trail development, outhouse installation, and four-wheel OHV use management are being addressed.
    Whiskey Creek - created a family friendly novice grade youth training track to enhance skills on in a safe atmosphere.  Further work to harden trails and limit dirt bike use of lower riparian areas is ongoing.
    Williams Lake - building and expanding out user created informal trails into a BC Recreation Site.  This will give a permanence and status to these dirt bike trails that forestall encroachment or elimination by other resource interests. At South Lakeside, we are working with the MTB community to preserve and share co-management of the single-track.  This includes negotiation of shared and single-use non-motorized trail segments, proper signage, install information kiosks, and performing trail sustainability work.  Many of the MTB community ride dirt bikes, particularly the downhill community.  We are also seeing increased cross-over due to MTB injuries.


MSF Dirt Bike School
MSF Dirt Bike School at Bear Creek has trained up over 20 new dirt bike riders so far this season. New riders to increase our presence as trail users with Province and Recreation Officers.  New riders to purchase bikes and accessories.  Expanding our MSF facilities to the Lower Mainland and to Kamloops continues, but lack of industry support outside Honda Canada in the Okanagan is limiting our options greatly.

NRRA (Natural Resource Road Act)
With Legislation due to be brought to the Floor in Spring 2016, we are working diligently to make sure that our trails and trail users needs are recognized in both the legislation and regulations.  Initially all motorized trails were to be regulated as Resource Roads, with all the attending restrictions applied as to licensing, insurance and vehicle regulations.

Gains from Legislation stakeholder discussions and reviews include:

    Acknowledgment that all motorized trails are not resource roads, and will be managed as trails with a lesser regulatory regime
        Single-track trails will be outside of scope of regulations
        Racing and family/youth riding will continue to thrive on Crown Land.
    Director of Recreation Sites and Trails is now being actively consulted to provide a balanced recreational use of Crown Resource Roads and trails
    Improved family riding opportunities through lower requirements for licensing and insurance on non-active resource roads
    Increased OHV safety by actively discouraging and/or control OHV use on active heavy haul roads
    Requirement of industry to provide advanced notice for resource road decommissioning.  This provides trail stewards greater opportunities to convert present resource roads into OHV recreational use via co-management.  Presently there is no direct ability for recreation to preserve these roads as trails as they are decommissioned.


ORV Act
In our recent letter to the BC Premier, one of the key items we stressed for the ORV Act implementation success is enacting our OHV Trails Trust to provide sustainable funding for dirt bike and other OHV trails.  The Provincial government has now ceded to postpone mandatory vehicle registration until November 1, 2015, and allow decals as vehicle identification instead of only motorcycle plates. 

As part of our moving forward on the implementation of the ORV Act, we continue to push enacting our OHV Trails Trust.  Providing resources to continue to build and maintain our world-class riding opportunities is one of the keys to trail sustainability and enjoyment for increasing ridership. This will provide a tremendous ability to provide trails opportunities for families, racers, trials riders, and wilderness single-track seekers including camping and staging facilities, professionally designed and built trails, plus resources for all our volunteer trail stewards.
