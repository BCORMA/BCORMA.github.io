<p><strong>BCORMA Trail Pass holders and riders,</strong></p>

<p>Vedder Mountains&#39; 200+ Km of multi-use single-track trails will be the site for <strong>CORMC&#39;s upcoming Fun Ride.</strong></p>

<p><strong>CORMC (Cascade Off Road Motorcycle Club)</strong> at <strong>Vedder Mtn</strong> in <strong>Chilliwack BC</strong> have been working hard to get our bridges repaired and trails ready for our upcoming <strong>November 8th 2015 Fun Trail Ride.</strong></p>

<p><strong>BCORMA, CORMC, and NTC </strong>have partnered to do <strong>$50k of trail works</strong> at Vedder. Come out and enjoy it. Funds go to supporting trails for dirt bikers.</p>

<p><strong>2016 BCORMA Trail Passes</strong> ($45) &amp; <strong>2016 CORMC memberships</strong> ($20) will be available at the event. <strong>All Funds towards making Vedder trails even better.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Ride the Fun Ride for $65 - buy a 2016 BCORMA Trail Pass through CORMC &amp; a 2016 CORMC membership. Or cost is $60</strong> (if you want to buy your BCORMA Trail Pass through your home club) &amp; <strong>includes a 2016 CORMC membership.&nbsp; Must have a 2016 BCORMA Trail Pass available from CORMC, local club, or BCORMA Store to ride the event.</strong></p>

<p>We have <strong>monthly Trail Work Days</strong>, which have been fun and well attended. We want to give special thanks to everyone that was there to help, or just lent us tools so we could do the jobs needed. We help out a few hours and then ride, that&rsquo;s what keeps it fun for all.</p>

<p><strong>See you at our next monthly trail work day, and the Fun Ride on Nov 8th.</strong></p>
