	Hi Everyone,</p>
<p>
	Just in time for the July long weekend, I&#39;ve put up new maps along with complete map books for Chipmunk, Nickle Mine, Tansky, and Vedder.&nbsp; Blue Mountain, Squamish, Peachland, and Kamloops maps are to followat the end of July once our cartographer gets back from her 6 weeks field research around Waddington.</p>
<p>
	The complete package consists of several mb of 300dpi maps including: overview, index, legend, and all the zoomed in detail maps.&nbsp; The maps you view on the webpages are low resolution for loading speed.&nbsp; The zoomed in maps include the trail segment numbers that correspond to the newly installed trail marker stakes, helping you plan your route and navigate.</p>
<p>
	Get out and play.&nbsp; Be safe, and consider all the other users on the trails.</p>
