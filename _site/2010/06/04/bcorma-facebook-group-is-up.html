<p>
	For those that would rather get their news from Facebook, BCORMA has a Facebook group.</p>
<p>
	Use it to start discussions, let us know what is important to you, ask questions, share photos, and help other dirt bikers keep up on what is going on around BC in the dirt bike world.</p>
<p>
	Its there for everyone to use.</p>
