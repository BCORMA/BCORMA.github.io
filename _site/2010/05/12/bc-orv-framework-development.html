<p>A large amount of riders have questions around the coming ORV Framework.  The framework will be addressing license and registration issues first, and is expected to be in place by November 2011.</p>

<p>Attached is the most recent overview published by the Government.  This work is an out growth of the ORV Coalition’s seven years of work to have our sports legitimized by Government.  Please read it to give yourself a background on the subject.</p>

<p>Ken McClelland of the Greater Kamloops Motorcycle Association and I will be sitting on the key stakeholders Joint Advisory Group (JAG) representing specifically off-road motorcycling’s interests, and overall the summer motorized sports.  Please communicate with us with your concerns and constructive ideas to make sure the enacted policy reflects your needs.</p>

<p>We will be communicating to everyone via this website as we move forward with the design and implementation of the Framework.  Please check back regularly, and use our forum to post your discussions around this subject.</p>
