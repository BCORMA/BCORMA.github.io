	We now have all the approvals to provide riders with our 2010 BCORMA Platinum - Insured Trail Pass. It is available on-line from the BCORMA site (http://bcorma.ca), and provides $1 million of 3rd party liability insurance from Oasis, along with a Platinum Trail Pass that shows your commitment to summer motorized trails in British Columbia.</p>
<p>
	Many areas we ride have Forest Service Roads passing through the riding area. Whether these are deactivated or not, under the law, we are required to have a minimum of $200,000 3rd party liability insurance to ride on or cross over these FSRs. The BCORMA Platinum - Insured offers a easy visible solution that is far cheaper than a fine from the local C&amp;E or RCMP.</p>
<p>
	It was designed to insure the rider, not the machine, so you can use it with numerous bikes. Even when you borrow a bike, you will be covered. Put the sticker on your helmet, and carry your printed invoice to show your friendly C&amp;E Officer.</p>
<p>
	Please inform other riders you know that this important coverage is available through BCORMA. Any questions, please email insurance@bcorma.ca</p>
