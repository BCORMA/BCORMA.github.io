<p><strong>Your Provincial Off-Road Motorcycle Federations from Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, Quebec, Ontario and British Columbia</strong> met over this past weekend in Toronto. We brainstormed on ways to make dirt biking in Canada even more fun for families and approachable for new riders.</p>

<p>As the <strong>Off-Road Council of the Motorcycle Council of Canada (MCC)</strong>, our focus over the next five years will be:</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Growth</strong> - introduce new riders to sport with MSF DirtBike School training - women, youth, returning riders, ADV riders</li>
	<li><strong>Sustainable Trails</strong> - Delivering NOHVCC &quot;Great Trails&quot; workshops across Canada</li>
	<li><strong>Youth Safety Education</strong> - Develop and deliver a national school-based safety education program</li>
	<li><strong>Advocate for Canadian dirt biking</strong> - as an inclusive healthy outdoor family recreation</li>
	<li><strong>Sharing information and experiences</strong> across Provincial Federations to grow our sport</li>
	<li><strong>Consistant Legislation across Canada</strong> that benefits dirt biking - MCC policy statements and expert guidance for Government staff</li>
</ul>
