<p>Just posted <strong>April 22nd, May 6th &amp; June 10th</strong> dates for <strong>Mike&#39;s</strong> <strong>BCORMA MSF DirtBike School</strong> classes at <strong>Bear Creek</strong>.&nbsp; Classes are for <strong>Adults &amp; Youth</strong>.&nbsp; Need more info, email me and I&#39;ll pass along to Mike.&nbsp; <strong>Popkum</strong> dates with <strong>Christy</strong> coming soon.</p>

<p><strong>BCORMA/Oasis Insurance</strong> has teamed up to give you <strong>3 great trail pass options</strong> to <strong>support BC dirt bike trails</strong>.&nbsp; Get your <strong>BCORMA Platinum-Insured, Bronze-Insured, or Bronze Trail Pass</strong> through our&nbsp; <strong>BCORMA Store</strong> - http://bcorma.ca/catalog/18</p>

<p><strong>BCORMA</strong> would like to thank the <strong>PNWMA</strong> and all the racers for its <strong>annual support to BCORMA</strong>.&nbsp; With the coming proposed <strong>Natural Resource Road Act</strong> legislation including speed limits and insurance on what could be our trails, its important that we have a strong dirt-bike stakeholder representation to the Government&#39;s legislation development.</p>
