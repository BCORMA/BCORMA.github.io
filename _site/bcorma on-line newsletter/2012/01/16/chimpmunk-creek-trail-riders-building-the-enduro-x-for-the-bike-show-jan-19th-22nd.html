<p>From the Chipmunk Creek Trail Riders, Chilliwack Valley</p>

<p>Hi guys</p>

<p>The weather was great and a group of us started 2012 right by riding the GVMC New Years Day Run. Mostly street bikes, but a group of dirt-bikes-with-plates were there too.  Check out the video on the link below.</p>

<p>Chris Harwood was going for a ride on Sunday, January 8th, but I didn’t get the notice in time to notify everyone. Hope he got together with friends and roosted some trails.</p>

<p>Coming up real quick is the Bike Show at Tradex, 19-22 of January. For those of you who don’t know, Dual Sport BC, the GVMC and friends are building an Endurocross track which should be highly entertaining for riders and spectators alike. Ray Keller, the man behind the aluminum structures at Chipmunk, has created a couple of diabolical “features” for the KTM Factory Team and other competitors to ride over. Check out the Bike Show web page for a picture of one structure, still under construction.</p>

<p>We’ll be setting everything up on Thursday morning, starting about 9:00am. We can use more help, so if anyone has the day off work, let me know. We’ll need a couple crash test dummies, too, to see if it’s actually rideable  before the first event on Friday morning. Send me an email if you can be there either for setup Thursday morning or teardown Sunday after 5:00 pm. We still have a few passes available for workers.</p>

<p>The GVMC are putting on two events at Chipmunk for 2012, the Piston Run on June 10 and a Trail Ride on August 26.  For the Trail Ride, we’re planning using trails in the upper bowl that no one has been riding for a few years, so they’ll need some maintenance when the snow clears. At this point we hadn’t planned on including an ATV course, but some of the upper trails, which include a couple hillclimbs, could be widened for ATV use.</p>

<p>BCORMA Trail Passes will be available at the Bike Show. The $45 Bronze Pass goes towards giving us a much-needed voice in off-road legislation, and also provides funds for trail maintenance. The $165 for Platinum includes liability insurance, which makes it legal to ride on Forest Service Roads. If you are a racer, show your Trail Pass and you’ll get $10 off the signup price at the Piston Run. If you’re a recreational rider, you must have a Trail Pass to ride the August event. There are two Blue Mountain rides which also require a Trail Pass, as well as DSBC events. If you trail ride in Kelowna, the Pass will save you money at Bear Creek. Check it all out the BCORMA kiosk at the Bike Show.</p>

<p>And when you do buy your Trail Pass, be sure to check the “Chipmunk Creek” box so the trail maintenance portion goes to your favourite riding area.</p>

<p>Anyone calling a ride? Let me know a few days ahead so I can get the notice out.</p>

<p>See you at the Bike Show!</p>
