	Hi Everyone,</p>
<p>
	Sorry about BCORMA&#39;s news feed being the source of 5 or 6 bogus news items from a spammer. Somehow the spammer defeated our CAPTCHA security for the first time. Thanks to Blue Mountain Motorcycle Club for notifying me right away.</p>
<p>
	I&#39;ve cleaned them out, and added another layer of security. Only BCORMA Editors can write news releases and newsletter, not all registered users. If you would like to continue to be able to write news stories and publish them though the BCORMA site and news-feed, please contact me and I&#39;ll give you Editor role permissions.</p>
<p>
	Have a great weekend. Get out and ride, enjoying the bit of sun we are finally getting.</p>
<p>
	Peter</p>
