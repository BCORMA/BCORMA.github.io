	Still some great riding to be had before our Canadian Winter finally sets in.&nbsp; Getting towards late Fall, with the snow starting up at higher elevations and rain on the Coast.&nbsp; After the driness of the late summer/early Fall it is almost welcome.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	Lots going on in BC over the summer. Features:</p>
<ul>
	<li>
		Main feature is provided by Kent Antoniak, RPF, of the GKMA. Kamloops has one of the largest, if not the largest, managed ORM trail network in BC.&nbsp; Kent talks about how they are collaborating with the Provincial Government to make it one of the premier places to ride in BC.</li>
	<li>
		Update on KTM support program.&nbsp; KTM gave $10 to BCORMA for every rider who visited their KTM dealer last Spring.&nbsp; We had the best turn-out of all of Canada, and will be putting $2,000 from KTM into our BCORMA Trail Stewardship account for increased stewardship education and support.</li>
	<li>
		First Annual BC PowerSports Show, held this October</li>
	<li>
		Squamish Ride Schools - giving riders a full day of top notch instruction.&nbsp; A go for 2013.&nbsp; Make sure you sign up early to get a spot.</li>
	<li>
		And much more.</li>
</ul>

	We are quite happy to have Wally volunteer his editor skills to highlight all the great riding and off-road motorcycling news from around BC.
