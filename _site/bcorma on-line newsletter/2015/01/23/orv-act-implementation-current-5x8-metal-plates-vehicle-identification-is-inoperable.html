<p>BCORMA is advocating to BC Government that decals are the only viable solution for ORV vehicle identification under the ORV Act. Please read our position brief, and provide copies to your MLA.</p>

<p>It is very important that MLA and Ministers hear the perspective from the riding community.  This is directly affecting us, and we are the experts because we ride and experience dirt bikes and other ORV.</p>

<p>Pass along to other riders, club members, and your MLA and their Assistants.</p>

<p>Any questions, please email peter.sprague@bcorma.ca</p>
