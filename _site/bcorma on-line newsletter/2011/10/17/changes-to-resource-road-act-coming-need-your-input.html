	Do you use B.C.&rsquo;s resource roads for work, recreation, or do you live in or visit rural communities that use resource roads?</p>
<p>
	If so, help the Ministry of Forests, Lands &amp; Natural Resource Operations serve you better by contributing to the Natural Resource Road Act Project (NRRA) to improve resource road laws and regulation for the benefit of all users.</p>
<p>
	Comments are invited on a DISCUSSION PAPER that will help build the foundation for the NRRA.&nbsp; The principles and proposed policy framework presented in this discussion paper are the starting point for a single, streamlined law that applies to the construction, maintenance, use and deactivation of all resource roads in B.C.</p>
