<p>Members clubs of <strong>ATVBC (Right Nuts ATV</strong>) and <strong>BCORMA (DualSportBC / GVMC)</strong> had over 40 volunteers donate over 250 hours this past weekend to prepare the area for use by all off road motorised users.</p>

<h3>New Tamihi Staging Area facility provides:</h3>

<ul>
	<li>Large parking area for all sizes or tow vehicles</li>
	<li>Level unloading/parking for pick up trucks</li>
	<li>Level unloading area</li>
	<li>Kids Area and Trails</li>
	<li>Large level campsites (big enough for the longest of rigs) with picnic tables and fire rings backing onto walking trails</li>
	<li>Dog friendly</li>
	<li>Large Out Houses</li>
	<li>EZ access to over 100kms of off road trails</li>
</ul>

<p>Still many small details to work out, so your comments are always welcome (particularly the good ones)</p>

<p>When riding at Tamihi respect the rules and other recreationalists to keep it open and get along with the other users:</p>

<ul>
	<li>SPEED LIMIT AT TAMIHI RECREATION AREA FSR IS 30 KPH</li>
	<li>IDLE IN IDLE OUT for staging areas and campgrounds (safety, dust, noise)</li>
	<li>SPARK ARRESTORS REQUIRED for all motorised vehicles</li>
	<li>KIDS AREA is for KIDS (and beginners)</li>
	<li>Less than 96dB (the quickest way to lose riding areas is being too loud)</li>
	<li>NO PARKING ON ROAD (thats why the staging area was built)</li>
</ul>
