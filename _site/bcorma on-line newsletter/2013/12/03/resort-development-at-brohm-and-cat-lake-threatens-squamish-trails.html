<p><strong>Greetings Fellow Dirt Bikers &amp; all trail recreationalists</strong>,</p>

<div>The <strong>Squamish Dirt Bike Association</strong> is asking for your support to help save <strong>Brohm</strong> and <strong>Cat Lake</strong> from a resort development almost equivalent to the size of Whistler.&nbsp;</div>

<ul>
	<li>The magnitude of this development is huge</li>
	<li><strong>BC&#39;s trail community</strong> will lose <strong>dirt bike</strong> and <strong>snowmobile terrain</strong>, plus <strong>access to all our trail systems</strong> unless we all join together.</li>
	<li><strong>Brohm Ridge</strong> is where the <strong>Black Tusk Snowmobile Club</strong> maintains a chalet and clubhouse year round.&nbsp; The chalet is also promoted as the <strong>Alpine Learning Institute</strong> where annually <strong>Avalanche Courses</strong> are conducted as well great <strong>snowmobiling</strong> terrain for those who travel from near and far.</li>
	<li>In the lower terrain, the <strong>SDBA</strong> has <strong>1000s of volunteer invested hours</strong> in <strong>dirt bike trails</strong>.&nbsp;</li>
	<li>We also stand to lose our <strong>sustainably-managed access</strong> to <strong>Brohm Ridge&#39;s alpine area</strong> during the summer months.&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Annually, the <strong>SDBA</strong> hosts the <strong>Cat Scratch Fever Hare Scramble Race</strong>, club events and group rides, all will the affected by this hugh private development on our Crown Lands.</li>
	<li>We are talking <strong>1000s of rider days per year gone</strong>, making a huge <strong>impact</strong> on <strong>Squamish&#39;s</strong> varied <strong>outdoor recreation tourism</strong>.</li>
	<li><strong>Squamish</strong> has <strong>over 10 months of dirt and mountain bike riding</strong> for the <strong>Lower Mainland</strong> to enjoy - <strong>all gone</strong> for the <strong>benefit of private developers and condo owners.</strong></li>
</ul>

<div>The <strong>SDBA</strong> and <strong>BTSC</strong> are not the only user groups that visit this area for outdoor recreational pursuits.&nbsp; The entire <strong>community of Squamish</strong> would feel the pressure in many ways.</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>
